My personal repository

I'm not a coder. I am a filmmaker who wants to use game engines like Unreal Engine 4 to create cinematics in preparation for feature length films. 

However, I do work for a company that works to create Virtual Reality arch-viz previews. Learning source code management is currently part of my job description. So here I am. Thanks for having me.
